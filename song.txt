I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising (oh, whoa)
Open your arms and pray to the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding
Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again
Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again
Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Is it desire (is it desire)
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose
Taking, pretending you're nothing but giving
Making me lose my cool
Faking my love game, baby, we're the same
Heart turned from good to cruel
You know that you've got me
You've loved me down
You tell me you want me now
Is it desire (it desire)
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire (I want desire, oh, whoa)
'Cause your love only gets me abused
Is it desire (is it desire)
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you? (That I'm feeling for you)
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose (oh, what you're willing to lose)
What you're willing to lose?
What you're willing to lose? (Is it desire?)
