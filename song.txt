I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising (oh, whoa)
Open your arms and pray to the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding
Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again
Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
'Cause your love only gets me abused
